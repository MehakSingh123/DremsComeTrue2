        <li>Try new things. You may not know what your dreams are, or they might be vague and unsubstantial. That's okay! Trying out new things is a great way to find things that you love. It can help introduce you to people and ideas that will be important in fulfilling your dreams.</li>
        <li>Decide whatâ€™s important. It's hard to know how to achieve a dream if you're not entirely sure what it is you want to make happen. Think hard about what you love to do, what makes you passionate, what invigorates you. This is the time when you can be vague and unspecific</li>   
        <li>Narrow your focus. Once you have large and somewhat vague ideas about what you'd like to do, it's time to narrow your focus so you can actually achieve these dreams. The more specific you are, the easier it will be to set a timeline and goals to achieve your dream.</li>
